# Play Preview Card

This is a simple web application so that I could learn more about how preview cards are created.

## Front-end

The front-end is built using Vite and React. To run the front-end follow these steps:

```bash
cd front-end
npm run dev
```

## Back-end

The back-end is built using Node.js and Express. To run the back-end, follow these steps:

```bash
cd back-end
npm run dev
```

The back-end should now be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.
